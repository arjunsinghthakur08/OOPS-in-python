    "ANS: Abstraction and encapsulation are two important concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP), but they serve different purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Abstraction:\n",
    "   Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex entities by focusing on their essential features and behaviors while hiding the irrelevant details. It provides a high-level view or a conceptual representation of an object. Abstraction is achieved through abstract classes or interfaces, which define the common attributes and methods that a group of related objects should have without specifying the implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   Consider the concept of a \"Vehicle.\" We can create an abstract class called `Vehicle` that defines common attributes and behaviors for any type of vehicle, such as `start()`, `stop()`, and `move()`. The `Vehicle` class can be extended by specific vehicle types like `Car` and `Motorcycle`, which provide their own implementations for the abstract methods. The `Vehicle` class represents the abstraction of a vehicle, while the concrete classes represent the implementation details specific to each type of vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Encapsulation:\n",
    "   Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) together within a class, while providing controlled access to them. It hides the internal details of an object and exposes only the necessary information through public interfaces. Encapsulation helps in achieving data abstraction, data hiding, and modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   Consider a class called `BankAccount` that represents a bank account. It may have private attributes such as `account_number` and `balance`, which should not be directly accessible from outside the class. To access or modify these attributes, the class provides public methods like `deposit()` and `withdraw()`. These methods encapsulate the logic for updating the account balance while hiding the internal details. By encapsulating the data and providing controlled access, the `BankAccount` class ensures data integrity and protects sensitive information."
