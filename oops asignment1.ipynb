    "ANS: The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of combining data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) into a single unit called an object. It hides the internal details of an object and provides a public interface to interact with it. Encapsulation helps in achieving data abstraction, data hiding, and modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. It enables the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes, where a child class (subclass) inherits characteristics from its parent class (superclass). Inheritance promotes code reusability and supports the concept of \"is-a\" relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same message or perform the same operation in different ways. It allows objects to take multiple forms or exhibit multiple behaviors based on the context. Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction refers to the process of simplifying complex real-world entities into their essential characteristics. It allows programmers to focus on the essential features of an object while hiding the irrelevant details. Abstraction helps in managing complexity, improving code maintainability, and creating reusable code component."
